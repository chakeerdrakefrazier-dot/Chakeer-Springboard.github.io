        About 
            Hello, my name is Chakeer Drake-Frazier. Thank you for taking the time to review my digital CV. 
            I am a proud husband to my wife, Chanda, and in August 2025 we welcomed our fifth child into our family. Born and raised in Denver, Colorado, I began my career as a Class A truck driver, traveling extensively across the region. In September 2025, I made the transition from trucking to software engineeringâ€”a field that combines my lifelong love of technology with my passion for art and creativity. 
            Pursuing a career in software development allows me to build solutions that are both innovative and practical while expressing my creative side. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, developing personal side projects, riding my motorcycle, and teaching third graders at our local church.
